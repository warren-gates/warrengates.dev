I am a software engineer from Littleton, Colorado. After graduating from Walla Walla University with a degree in Accounting, I realized my true interest lay in a more techy direction. I successfully escaped the world of accounting and have since worked as a network administrator and software engineer.

When not engrossed in a tech, I spend my time with my wife skiing, mountain biking, hiking, and exploring our city. My beautiful wife and I live in Littleton with our two cats.
